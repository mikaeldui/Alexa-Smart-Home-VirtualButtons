Goal is to keep this totally free.  We live within the "always free" Amazon
tier.

Services used (as far as I can tell)

  Lambda: Free tier is 1,000,000 requests per month
          400,000 GB-seconds
          We have a setting of 128Mb size with timeout of 3 seconds (worst
          case; most calls only take 5ns, and the account linking takes 1.1s)
          so that becomes 1,066,666 requests, so the 1 million request
          value applies.  Calls are made whenever a status is queried (eg
          if you open the Alexa app and look at the device state), or if
          you ask Alexa for info ("is the door open"), or if you do a disovery.
          Note: Leaving the app open on a device page could generate a call
          every 3 secs as it tries to keep the current state refreshed.

          In building this skill, 385 requests in a week, 7.364 seconds of
          compute

  Dynamodb: provisioned for 5 units == 20Kb of data,   2 reads per second
                                       10Kb of update, 1 write per second
            Free tier handles 25 units, 25Gb Data.

  CloudWatch: Free is 5Gb of logs per month

  API Gateway: Uh oh, this isn't always free; 12 months only.  After that
               it costs $1 for 1,000,000 messages.  An API call is normally
               only made if you use the API to define buttons, or to trigger
               an event ("button pressed").  The AWS pricing calculator for
               1,000 calls per month (30 per day) comes out as $0.00.  In
               developing this skill I made 87 calls, and some of those
               were just "heh, that's fun, do it again" tests!  10,000 per
               month (approx one every 5 minutes) might cost you 1 cent.

  Data Transfer: Hmm, using API Gateway also uses Data Transfer.  The first
                 1Gb is free.  I used 0.000024Gb in my tests!
